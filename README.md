# SimpleMoneyMaker
Hello there!

I've created a very simple money conversion project from a project I've done in the Codecademy coursework. 

When opening the program, build and run the project, when prompted input the amount of money you wish to convert into individual coins. 

(For instance, if you have $1 it will convert into four quarters, $1.13 would convert to four qaurters, a dime, and three pennies, etc)

Thanks for looking, and happy coding!
